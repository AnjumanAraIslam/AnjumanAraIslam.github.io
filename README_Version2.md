# Portfolio — Anjuman Ara Islam

This is a clean, responsive single-page portfolio template built to be visually attractive and CV-ready.

What I created
- index.html — main single-page portfolio
- assets/css/style.css — styles and theme support
- assets/js/main.js — small interactive bits: theme toggle, typewriter, skill animations, smooth scroll
- A simple placeholder `resume.pdf` link is referenced in the page — replace it with your real CV file.

How to use
1. Copy the files into a folder (for example, `portfolio`).
2. Replace text like the About paragraph, email, and project details with your own content.
3. Replace `resume.pdf` with your actual CV (same folder or a hosted URL).
4. Host on GitHub Pages or any static host (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

Customize
- Edit the heading in `index.html` if you want a different name/heading.
- Change skill percentages in the `.skill-percent` `data-value` attributes.
- Swap out placeholder project cards with screenshots and real links.

Notes
- The contact form included is non-functional and calls a small demo handler. Integrate with an email API or form backend for production.
- The design supports a dark/light theme that persists across visits.

If you want, I can:
- Convert this to a multi-page site or a React/Vue template.
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Generate a ready-to-use PDF resume page from this template.
